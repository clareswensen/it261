        <p>I received my undergraduate degree from The Evergreen State College where I spent a significant time studying mycology. Since then, I have made it a big part of my life. There is so much to learn, enjoy, and share with others. I often find myself having conversations with people that are very entriged by mushrooms. There are so many powerful aspects of fungi such as treating PTSD and cancer, cleaning up toxic waste sites with bioremediation, and culinary uses. After many conversations, I really wanted to create a resource for the novice, turning mycophobes into mycophiles. </p>

        <p>I began developing a website and using social media to implement my ideas. I was soon intimidated by how much there is to learn about website development and social media engagement. Although I was overwhelmed, I was really enjoying all the new things I was learning. I decided I need a more structured approach to what I was learning and could see myself using my new skills to develop a full scale business idea. This is when I decided to enroll in the Web Development program at Seattle Central College. I am now in my third quarter and feel I have really found something in which I can use my problem solving skills, creativity, and passion for learning into a fullfilling career path. I am excited to see where this road takes me.</p>
